## Scope
At the <a href="http://www.ualg.pt/">University of Algarve</a> we offer two post-graduate degrees (<a href="https://fchs.ualg.pt/en/curso/1471">Master</a> and <a href="https://fchs.ualg.pt/en/curso/1673">Ph.D.</a>) in Archaeology. Both are run in straight collaboration with <a href="http://www.icarehb.com/">ICArEHB</a> (Interdisciplinary Center for Archaeology and Evolution of Human Behavior), whose research is organized in four main groups - **Prehistoric Coastal Adaptations**, **African archaeology and Human Evolution**, **Development of Complex Societies**, and **History of Archaeological Science**. ICArEHB's projects focus mostly on using different disciplines and methodological approaches, such as material analysis, geoarchaeology, use-wear analysis, zooarchaeology, paleobotany and GIS.<p>
<p> Given my expertise and research focus I am particularly interested in working with students in stone tool analysis and quantitative methods applied to archaeology.<p>

## Funding
<p> We have several yearly funding opportunities for Ph.D. candidates, both from internal funds and external institutions. These calls are available in the Education & Career section of <a href="http://www.icarehb.com/">ICArEHB's website</a>.<p>
<p> Most of these funding schemes include a monthly salary of 1064â‚¬ during 48 months, social security, tuition and fees, as well as yearly hotel and travel for congress presentation. The fellows will also have 22 days of vacation yearly.<p>
