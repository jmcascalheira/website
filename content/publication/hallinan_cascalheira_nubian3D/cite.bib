  abstract = {Levallois technology, a hallmark of Middle Palaeolithic stone tool manufacture, involves sophisticated core reduction strategies that have major implications for understanding human cognitive and technological evolution. However, traditional methods of analysing Levallois cores often fail to capture the nuanced variability in their morphology. This study introduces a novel application of three-dimensional geometric morphometrics (GM) to quantify the shape variability of Nubian Levallois cores from the Nile Valley and Dhofar regions. By employing this technique, we analysed core surfaces and preferential scar shapes, identifying distinct regional and technological patterns. Our results reveal significant inter-regional differences in core elongation and surface convexity, highlighting the importance of shape-oriented, rather than metric-based, analysis of prepared cores. This new GM approach offers a robust and replicable tool for investigating lithic variability and holds potential for broader applications in Palaeolithic research, enhancing our understanding of human technological adaptations.},
