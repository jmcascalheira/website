abstract: "Analyses of raw materials and the distinction between local/regional and long-distance sources have proven invaluable for understanding the extensive movements, interactions, and social networks during the Upper Palaeolithic in the Iberian Peninsula. However, unlike other parts of Iberia, research on the management and acquisition of raw materials in the south and west of Iberia remains relatively underdeveloped. Despite significant knowledge about the technological practices of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers from southern Portugal, particularly from studies conducted at the site of Vale Boi, there is a noticeable lack of focus on raw materials management. This paper presents the first comprehensive characterisation of chert raw materials from the Gravettian, Proto-Solutrean, and Solutrean occupations at Vale Boi, using both macroscopic and petrographic techniques. Our study reveals that the majority of chert found at Vale Boi originates locally, within a 20 km radius. However, a non-negligible portion of the chert comes from non-local sources, indicating > 200 km raw material circulation from central Portugal and southern Spain."
