<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.ualg.pt/">University of Algarve</a> we offer two post-graduate degrees (Master and Ph.D.) in Archaeology. Both are run in straight collaboration with <a href="http://www.icarehb.com/">ICArEHB</a> (Interdisciplinary Center for Archaeology and Evolution of Human Behavior), whose research is organized in four groups - **Prehistoric Coastal Adaptations**, **African archaeology and Human Evolution**, **Development of Complex Societies**, and **History of Archaeological Science**. Our projects focus mostly on the emergence of Anatomically Modern Humans, hunter-gatherer coastal adaptations, the development of complex societies, and African archaeology using different disciplines and methodological approaches, such as material analysis, geoarchaeology, use-wear analysis, zooarchaeology, paleobotany and GIS.<p>
<p>Given my expertise and research focus I am particularly interested in stone tool analysis and quantitative methods applied to archaeology.

<h3>Funding</h3>
<p> Usually, we have several funding opportunities for Ph.D. candidates, both from internal funds and external institutions. These calls are available in the Positions & Fellowships section of <a href="http://www.icarehb.com/">ICArEHB's website</a>.<p>
